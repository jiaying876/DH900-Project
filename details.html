                <p class="urban-village-in">
                  <br />Urban village in China is a unique phenomenon that formed part of China&#39;s urbanization efforts.
                  Urban villages are villages that appear in the downtown segments of major Chinese cities.  <br /><br />As
                  a result of the dual urban-rural system that has long been in place in China, i.e., urban and rural
                  areas are under different modes of management, with urban land belonging to the State and rural land
                  belonging to the rural collectives. Because of the rapid urbanization and expansion, rural land has
                  been expropriated by the State, while villagers still live in villages built on the basis of the
                  original villages. These villages are gradually surrounded by high-rise buildings, urban architecture,
                  and infrastructure, forming urban villages.

              <p class="p">
                The urban village was regarded as a negative or unnecessary symbol of the historical past of the city
                and reinforced the social stigma of the area. However, these areas afford economic opportunity to
                newcomers to the city and the people who live in also is an important part of developing the urban
                economy. In the past two decades, a large number of urban villages have been demolished and
                regenerated.<br /><br />Therefore, conflicts unavoidably arise. The main conflicts include conflicts
                between the development of the city, the needs of the government and the villagers, the conflict
                interests between villagers and the complex property ownership.<br /><br />Because the government cannot
                afford the cost of demolition and relocation, so brings in outside real estate developers. Most of the
                villages take the solution that demolishing 1 square meter and the government will compensate 1 square
                meter.

              <p class="p">
                The urban village, as a unique trace of growth in the city, is more like a crack that has to be filled
                in for the overall beauty and good development of the city. But it has become an important part of the
                urban history of modernization and development because of the residents who live here, the special forms
                of architecture, and the strange split and fusion of rural and urban images.<br /><br />Urban village is
                disappearing in the history of city now.  So I would like to create an archive to collect the images,
                videos and news to make it visible and clear in the history. In my hometown Guangzhou, there are totally
                more than 100 urban villages. Different villages experience different demolition difficulties.  So I
                choose to build my archive by comparing two urban villages.<br /><br />In the first urban village(LieDe
                village) I chose, the demolition process went smoothly and took a relatively short period, but another
                urban village just 3km away from this one took nearly 15 years to demolish and rebuild(Xian village).<br /><br />The
                demolition process and the battle between villagers and the government experienced in these two urban
                villages were completely different.
